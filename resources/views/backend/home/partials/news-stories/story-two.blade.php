        V2.1.3 gives blog owners a nice landing page to call home. For the newly initiated, this page
        will give quick links to common actions in the administrative sections. To the pro-bloggers out
        there, quickly jot down a blog draft and save it on the fly. You also get a nice overview
        of the status of the site, from Disqus and Google Analytics to Maintenance Mode and the number
        of posts or tags you might have.
